I called several roofing companies for a bid on my roof and this was the company that stood out from the rest in bid presentation, quality of product and professionalism. Their communication through the process was exemplary as was their attention to detail. The owner and his crew are definitely 5* quality! Thank you Tim, Ben and crew!</p>

I particularly liked seeing the Owner hands on with the training and development of his team. Work Smart, follow the process, is what I got out of his directions, and than he inspected his expectations! Thank you! I highy recommend this business.</p>

            <p class="testimonial_content">It wasnâ€™t an easy process to find a right contractor to replace my old LP siding. Most of the proposals from a few contractors were very close to each other in many aspects except one unreasonably expensive out-of-state Siding company. High Ridge Roofing and Construction was our choice mostly influenced by the Owner, Timâ€™s energy toward the project, and that was the right choice. They did a great job. The whole team was courteous during the month-long work. After the completion of the work, the owner, Tim came back a few times to inspect the details and made final touchups. I donâ€™t think I can ask better work than that. I do highly recommend Tim and his crew</p>

            <p class="testimonial_content">In the process of selling our home we found the roof needed repairs and in a hurry. We must have contacted six other companies in the area before we called Tim at High Ridge Construction. Tim was the only contractor to answer his phone and he made it our to our home within two days to provide an estimate. His estimate was well below the other companies and he was able to get us in within a week compared to months with the other guys. Tim and his crew are fantastic, I recommend them for any job without hesitation.</p>

        <div class="three_single single_testimonial">
            <p class="testimonial_content">Tim gave me a quick and accurate quote and was one of the most competitive bids. The bid price and the final price for the roof was the sameâ€¦ no mistakes or overruns. The project was completed as soon as the weather permitted, and the cleanup of debris was terrific. There was no sign that they had even been there. During this project, I asked Tim to fix some warped fascia boards and rebuild the chimney enclosure. He even painted them both and the cost was only for time and materials. He is a conscientious businessman and a master roofing craftsman. I would hire him again to do any other job, and I would probably skip the process of asking other contractors for bids. I was THAT impressed with him and his work.</p>
